#  Jogging-Times-Tracker

This is the back-end API for Jogging-Times Tracker+ tracks your distance, pace, and more. It's the most accurate running distance/time tracker available on the market, packed into the simplest & most gorgeous interface. It also maintains a history of your runs and improvements over time and shows you a complete log of your running activities


- Authentication: Create account/login/logout.
- When logged in, a user can view, edit and delete entered `jogging times`.
- Implement three roles with different permission levels:
- A regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records
- A user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time.
- Filter by dates from-to.
- Report on average speed & distance per week.
